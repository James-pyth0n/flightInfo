# flightInfo
Function to return flight info from flightradar24
The only info I wanted was flight number and plane id
Other info is obtained such as location, heading and altitude

This was created after a problem with flightradar24.com not displaying the info I was after
This is part a larger routine that uses pyflightdata for much more info
